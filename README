Chess move generation library in C99.

It is fast - can generate 587 million moves per second on my potato machine.
It does however require BMI2 enabled CPUs (Haswell/Zen3 or newer).

To build the perft test, compile main.c using your favourite compiler.
A makefile is included for a clang PGO build.

If you find a bug please open an issue or email me (ellxor@protonmail.ch).
